Feature: display and order of events in Day View

Background:
    Given I am a Visitor on a site with TEC
    Given the site timezone is America/Los_Angeles
    Given there are 13 events on this site
        | event name       | start date-time        | duration       |
        | strawberry S-T-P | today -3 days -2 hours | 4 hours        |
        | banana M-A-P     | today -2 days all day  | 1 day          |
        | eggplant M-A-N   | today -2 days all day  | 4 days         |
        | apple S-T-P      | today -2 days -2 hours | 1 hour         |
        | cabbage S-T-P    | today -2 days -2 hours | 4 hours        |
        | lettuce M-T-N    | today -2 days -2 hours | 4 days 4 hours |

        | melon S-T-N	   | today -2 hours         | 4 hours        |

        | carrot S-T-U     | today +2 days +2 hours | 4 hours        |

# technically the above requires that it is between 2:01am and 9:59pm PST
# coded letters in the event name denote whether that event is multiday or single day, timed or all day, and previous or now or upcoming.

Scenario: Day View today
    Given the Datepicker is on default (today, current time in site timezone)
    When I view the Day View
    Then I should see these 2 events in this order displayed under "All Day": "eggplant M-A-N", "grape S-A-N"
    And I should see "lettuce M-T-N" displayed under "Ongoing"
    And I should see these 2 events in this order displayed under a heading of now -4 hours: "parsnip S-T-P", "lemon S-T-N"
    And I should see "melon S-T-N" displayed under a heading of now -2 hours

# If two events start at the same time, the one ending sooner should be listed first (regardless of Publish date)
# If two events start at the same time and end at the same time, the one published first is listed twice.
