        | Cinnamon     | Spice World  |                     |            |                      |           |

    And I am viewing upcoming events in List View
    When I see the listing for <event>
    Then I should see the following venue information listed under the event title: <venue display>
    And the venue information should wrap if it exceeds the space

    Examples
        | event        | venue display              |
        | Cinnamon     | Spice World                |
        | Thyme        | Spice Palace Corvallis, OR |
        | Basil        | Spincington's Portland, OR |

        | Oregano      | BC                         |
